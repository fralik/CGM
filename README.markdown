## CGM: Custom Google™ Menu, v.1.0
#

Custom Google™ Menu aims to help you arrange links to Google services on the Gmail™ page. Links are represented as boxes and the new layout is created by dragging and dropping these boxes. It works both in Opera and Chrome browsers. This extension is a result of further work on [Reader Is Back](https://github.com/fralik/Reader-is-back) extension.

## Installation process

However, you could build the extension from the source code I encorage you to download it from [Opera Extensions]() or [Chrome Extensions]() websites.

## Known issues

1. If you click the extension icon in the toolbar and do not see any links in the openned window, then close current Gmail tab and open a new one.

2. The default language for CGM is English. However, in Opera there is a setting of preferred languages (Options -> Language -> Details). This setting may affect the default locale for CGM. For example, your locale is Spannish (es), CGM is translated to Russian (ru) and English (en). Your preferred languages are set to es, ru, en. In such a case the description of CGM on the extensions page will be in Russian. The contents of popup window will be in English.

3. In Chrome when you drag an item the page will scroll to the bottom. It can be annoying if you have small list of visible links.

## Permissions
In order to work properly I set acess permissions to some web adresses including google.com. I do not read or access any of your personal information. I do not read or store your browsing history. The source code of the extension is open, so you can check what and how do I do.

## Issues
I test the extension before each release, but if you have found a bug, please report it in the [Issue Tracker]()
