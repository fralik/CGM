How to add translation?
=======================

In general there are two types of information that we want to translate: used in the extension metafile and used in the extension itself. The following describes where the information is stored based for a particular browser.

Opera extension
---------------
The metainformation about the extension can be found in _config.xml_ file. The _name_ field should be left as is. Do not translate the name. We are interested in _description_ field. The localization consist in adding multiple versions of _description_ element, specifying their respective language. The format of _description_ tag:
    <description xml:lang="locale">Your translation</description>
Change _locale_ string to the actual name of the locale which is the standard IANA language subtag (http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry). You may also want to refer to Opera manual: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/creating-multilingual-extensions/ Note, that you should refer only to the information describing the translation of the metafile.

Content localization.
To translate the content open _common.js_ file and edit _i18n.messages_ variable. The format goes like this:
    'ID':
    {
        'default': 'Default translation, which is used if browser uses locale that is not supported by our extension. Generally, this means text in English.',
        'localeName': 'translation text'
    },
    
For example, if we have the following block
    'app_name':
    {
        'default': 'Custom Google Menu',
        'ru': 'Прокачаем–ка гугловское–меню'
    }
and you want to add German translation, then the result will be
    'app_name':
    {
        'default': 'Custom Google Menu',
        'ru': 'Прокачаем–ка гугловское–меню'
        'de': 'Das neue Menü für Google',
    }

    
Google extension
----------------

Google uses slightly different method of internatialization. All translations are done in *_locales* folder. This folder contains subfolders named by a locale name (complete list of supported locales http://code.google.com/chrome/webstore/docs/i18n.html#localeTable). Each subfolder contains file _messages.json_. To make a translation you should:
1. Make a new folder under *_locales* folder.
2. Copy existing _messages.json_ files from another local folder to newly created.
3. Translate _messsages_ in the file. You can leave _description_ fields as is.
